# Gochat

## Getting started

#### Requirements
 * [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
 * [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
 * `docker-compose` (usually bundled with `docker`, otherwise `pip install
   docker-compose`)


#### (Re)starting the dev. env.
Make sure you have ports `4690` and `4691` available on your machine and simply
run:
```shell
make dev
```
This should make our frontend available under `http://localhost:4690` and our
backend under `http://localhost:4691`.

##### Usage
Just visit the frontend under `http://localhost:4690/#coop` to log into the
chat, as user `coop` and, in another window, as user `gordon` by reaching
`http://localhost:4690/#gordon`.

Using the above handles (without the `#` sign), your users shoud be able to
communicate. Feel free to add a third `#ben` user... and as many other users
with as many names as you wish.

##### Notes

The command can be used to spawn the dev. env. for the first time but, thanks to
the magic of `make`, it can also be used to repull the dependencies, rebuild the
golang binary (and its associated container) and restart it. In other words, the
development workflow boils down to

" change code -> `make dev` -> fix bugs -> `make dev` -> ... "

Note that `make` decides to re-pull the dependencies and rebuild the binary only
if necessary (according to the files that changed).

#### Monitoring your dev. env.
Since components are launched in containers, I highly recommand to use [ctop](https://github.com/bcicen/ctop).

#### Tailing logs from the dev. env.
```shell
make devlog
```

#### Destroying the dev. env.
```shell
make devdown
```

#### Cleaning build artifacts & vendor folder
```shell
make clean
```
(it also destroys the dev. env. if the latter is up)

#### Without docker and docker-compose
You'll need Go 1.8+ and `glide` (`go get github.com/Masterminds/glide`).

* Pull the dependencies with `glide install`
* Build gochat in `./main`
* Run it (`./gochat -h` for more CLI help)

Here's an example of a working build command, that would also start `gochat` on
port `4691` with verbose logs:

```shell
go build -o gochat ./main && ./gochat -log-level debug
```

You'll additionnaly need to run the frontend, which can simply be opened in your
browser, as a static file (it lives under `./front`).
